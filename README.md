# Unit tests to reach 100% coverage
A mock function to create tests around....

 Simple flux calculator to determine the amount of flux needed to leave
 the schwartzchild radius in a black hole.
  
 Simply put: 
 - It is only worth calculating if b and d are non-zero.
 - We are screwed (infinite flux) if c is non-zero while the array, a, is empty.
 - The third value in the array (if given) sets the flux to be at lest 42 but no more than 69.
 - If the array only consists of a single value, the flux will be 12 times this value
